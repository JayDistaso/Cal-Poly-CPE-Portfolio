Summary:
This is a program that that launches the pipeline “ls | sort -r > outfile” and
waits for it to terminate. When it is finished, outfile should consist of a listing of the files in
the current directory in reverse alphabetical order.

Return Value:
If something fails (a pipe, opening a file, a fork, or a child process does not exit successfully)
then this program will return non-zero. Else this program will return 0;

To build:
"make pipeit"
