To make use 
$make liblwp.so

It seems the sched has some problems switching over. If only I had the
budget to fix.

*rant* 
After having so many problems getting context_switch to work, going from
not switching to this is one day with 8 hrs of class is not too bad
as far as I am concerned. Should I have done more earlier? Of course :)
*end rant*


To compile the three test programs, be sure to link them with the 
appropriate libraries:

  threaded counting:

    gcc -o nums numbersmain.c -L. -lPLN -lsnakes

  hungrysnakes:

    gcc -o hs hungrymain.c -L. -lPLN -lsnakes -lncurses

  randomsnakes:

    gcc -o rs snakemain.c -L. -lPLN -lsnakes -lncurses

Each of the snake programs installs signal handlers such that
SIGINT (^C) will kill a snake, and SIGQUIT (^\) will terminate
threading.
