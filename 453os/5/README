Compile both files with make

Usage:

minls [ -v ] [ -p part [ -s subpart ] ] imagefile [ path ]
Minls lists a file or directory on the given filesystem image. If the optional
path argument is ommitted it defaults to the root directory.

minget [ -v ] [ -p part [ -s subpart ] ] imagefile srcpath [ dstpath ]
Minget copies a regular file from the given source path to the given destination
path. If the destination path is ommitted, it copies to stdout.

Using undefined syntax will lead to undefined results.

-----------Excuses here-----------
Didnt pass as many tests as I would have liked to, but I have many finals to
study for. 

HOWEVER it is better than it seems, most of my diff failures
look to be due to the same one small bug, that some kind of non-printing / 
appears in binary file difference due to the way zeros are being put into the
output. 

Also some intersting heap corruption causing malloc and fread to fail, Which
made me glad I put in so many systemcall verifier blocks! I always get
marked down for those so I put a ton in this program. 

-Have Mercy and Happy Holidays :)
